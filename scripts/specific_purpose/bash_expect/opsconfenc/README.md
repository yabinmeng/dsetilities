## Prerequisites 

1. Linux "expect" utility is installed
```bash
$ sudo apt-get install expect
$ sudo yum install expect
```
2. The local encryption key (e.g. "/etc/opscenter/opsc_system_key" by default) has already been created in advance.

NOTE: please refer to [document](https://docs.datastax.com/en/opscenter/6.1/opsc/configure/encryptSensitiveConfigValues.html) for procdure description of prerequites 2 and 3 

## Automation Challenge and Utility Overview

After the local encryption key has been created, you can execute the OpsCenter encrpytion tool("opscenter_system_key_tool value") to encrypt the configuration value of interest. This tool, however, doesn't take any input argument and requires manual entry of the to-be-encrypted value from the command-line console. 

From automation perspective (e.g. Chef or Ansible), this behavior represents a big challenge. The utility introduced here aims to address this challenge by creating a wrapper facility around the original OpsCenter encryption tool "opscenter_system_key_tool value". This utility takes one input parameter as the value to be encrpted and it automatically simulates the double-manual-entry behavior as required by the original tool, through linux "expect" script.

The entry point of this utility is a bash script ***encryptopsc.sh***. The usage and one example is listed below:

```bash
encryptopsc.sh <value_to_be_encrypted>
