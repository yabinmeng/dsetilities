2) Provision an on-prem K8s cluster with locally attached storage space using K8s SIG provisioner ([link](https://github.com/yabinmeng/dseutilities/blob/master/documents/tutorial/k8s/local_pv_sig.md)).
3) Deploy a DSE cluster on an on-prem K8s cluster with locally attached storage ([link](https://github.com/yabinmeng/dseutilities/blob/master/documents/tutorial/k8s/k8s_cass_operator_local.md)).
4) Deploy a DSE cluster on GCP with XFS file system, external access to DSE, and dedicated GCP service account ([link](https://github.com/yabinmeng/dseutilities/blob/master/documents/tutorial/k8s/k8s_cass_operator_gke.md)).
